# Building up a battery assembly lab, part 1

When I started working with batteries, I noticed that it was easier to find very detailed academic information about batteries than simple advice about what kind of equipment is needed to build batteries. With googling and discussions with other researchers, I managed to find some information and started to gather the necessary devices and their accessories. In our lab, we had long experience on the printing and coating processes, both in small and pilot scale, so it was relatively easy for me to work with that part. In addition, my other colleagues had a lot of experience on battery characterization in large scale, which of course helped a lot. But we did not have enough capabilities for battery manufacturing and characterization of small cells. There are some special steps in workflow, which we had to consider.
As it was not always so easy to find suitable (simple enough) advice, I want to share here some basic requirements for a battery lab. Just in case someone else is facing the same problem or just wants to know how batteries are made. Please however note that this list is a very simplified one.
To start with, you need to be able to build coin cells to do some basic tests for the battery materials. And for doing that, you need at least this set of equipment
